I am a researcher specializing in eye movements during reading and word identification, with a focus on parafoveal processing on one hand and improving methodology on the other hand. I completed [my PhD](https://escholarship.org/content/qt37r9s335/qt37r9s335.pdf) with [Keith Rayner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Rayner_(psychologist)) at the [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) in 2013 and then spent about 10 years at [Bournemouth University](https://bournemouth.ac.uk) in the United Kingdom, where I reached the level of Principal Academic. 

Since 2023, I have been a Principal Investigator at the [Centro de Investigación Nebrica en Cognición (Acronym: CINC, Nebrija Research Center on Cognition)](https://www.nebrija.com/en/research/groups/cognitive-science-center.php), which is part of the [School of Language and Education](https://www.nebrija.com/en/the-university/schools/education-languages/) at [Nebrija University](https://nebrija.com) in Madrid, Spain.
